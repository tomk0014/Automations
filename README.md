# Automations

This is a very small automation that captures all the TBS Policies in both English and French.

The automation currently saves the .CSV files according to my filepath on my computer. Please change the write directory if repo is cloned. 
Later on, when these automations are moved to a Cloud environment with orchestration, a different filepath will be needed.

Lastly, within the ".objects" folder, there is an Excel Spreadsheet that manages the Eng+Fr links called "PolicyInstruments.xlsx". 
Changing the URLs or adding/removing will tell the automation what to fetch.

The delta will be developed soon.
